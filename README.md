# Data Structures and Algorithms with Python3 

## Introduction 

This repository contains a collection of data structures notes and examples written in Python3.   

The notes are written based on [Introduction to ALgorithms, 3rd](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms-third-edition).

Example problems are taken from either [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) or [Introduction to Algorithms, 3rd](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms-third-edition).

All codes are written by myself. Images are created by myself. 

This repository is great for those who are learning data structure fors the first time and those who want to review data structures for an interview. 

Please do not hesitate to use it if it is helpful to you. 

Pobody's nerfect. Free free to let me know how I can improve the notebooks ;)

## Dependencies 

### Jupyter Themes 
My favorite Jupyter Notebook theme is Monokai from [jupyterthemes](https://github.com/dunovank/jupyter-themes):

Step 1: install jupyterthemes using 

``pip install jupyterthemes``

Step 2: select the following settings 

``jt -t monokai -f ubuntu -nf ptsans -tf exosans -T -N``

### Jupyter Notebook Extensions 

In order for you to see what I see, I strongly recommend installing [``jupyter_contrib_nbextensions``](https://jupyter-contrib-nbextensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) 
and enable the following nbextensions:

- Table of Contents (2)
- Collapsible Headings
- Equation Auto Numbering 
- Codefolding
