# Data Structures and Algorithms with Python3 

## Introduction 

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks on data structures and algorithms in Python3.   

The notes are written based on [Introduction to Algorithms, 3rd](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms-third-edition).

Example problems are taken from either [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) or [Introduction to Algorithms, 3rd](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms-third-edition).

This repository is great for those who are learning data structures for the first time and those who want to review data structures or those who want to learn data structures in Python3. 

All content is created by myself. However, pobody's nerfect. Feel free to point out any mistakes or suggest any improvements ;)

### Texts 

- [Introduction to Algorithms, 3rd edition](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms-third-edition)

- [Introduction to the Analysis of Algorithms, 2nd edition](https://aofa.cs.princeton.edu/home/)


## Contents

TBD.

## Dependencies

Python 3.8.5

Anaconda 4.9.2 

## Jupyter Notebook Settings 

The basic Jupyter Notebook is neither efficient nor easy on the eyes. Below are what I do to improve both. 

### Jupyter Themes 
My favorite Jupyter Notebook theme is monokai from [jupyterthemes](https://github.com/dunovank/jupyter-themes):

Step 1: install jupyterthemes 

``pip install jupyterthemes``

Step 2: select the theme and various fonts for codes, texts, and notebooks. 

``jt -t monokai -f ubuntu -nf ptsans -tf exosans -T -N``

### Jupyter Notebook Extensions 

Since the notebooks are relatively long, I strongly recommend installing [jupyter_contrib_nbextensions](https://jupyter-contrib-nbextensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) 
and enabling the following nbextensions:

- Table of Contents (2)
- Collapsible Headings
- Equation Auto Numbering 
- Codefolding
