# Data Structures and Algorithms with Python3 

## Introduction 

This repository contains a collection of data structures notes and examples written in Python3.   

The notes are written based on [Introduction to ALgorithms, 3rd](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms-third-edition).

Examples are taken from [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) or [Introduction to Algorithms, 3rd](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms-third-edition).

Codes are written by myself. Images are created by myself. 

## Dependencies 

### Jupyter Themes 
My favorite Jupyter Notebook theme is Monokai from [jupyterthemes](https://github.com/dunovank/jupyter-themes):

Step 1: install jupyterthemes using 

``pip install jupyterthemes``

Step 2: select the following settings 

``jt -t monokai -f ubuntu -nf ptsans -tf exosans -T -N``

### Jupyter Notebook Extensions 

In order for you to see what I see, I strongly recommend installing [``jupyter_contrib_nbextensions``](https://jupyter-contrib-nbextensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) 
and enable the following nbextensions:

- Table of Contents (2)
- Collapsible Headings
- Equation Auto Numbering 
- Codefolding
